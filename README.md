*Key Features:*
- Real-time disaster reporting
- GPS-enabled verification
- Resource matching engine
- Secure volunteer coordination
- Scalable architecture with open-source APIs

## 2. 🌪 Introduction
DisasterConnect streamlines chaotic response scenarios using:
- 🆘 SOS Request Button  
- 📝 Task Board for Volunteers  
- 🚚 Logistics and Supply Chain Tracking  
- 🌿 Green Relief Planning  
- 💸 Donation Management  
- 📸 Crowdsourced Damage Reports  
- 🗺 Interactive Map for Situational Awareness  

The platform emphasizes *live updates, **coordination, and **automation* to save lives and mobilize resources efficiently.

## 3. 🔍 Related Work
While platforms like *Ushahidi, **ReliefWeb, and **HDX* offer crisis mapping, they are often *institutional, require technical input, and are not tailored for **citizen engagement*.

DisasterConnect improves upon:
- *Sahana Eden* (centralized, lacks flexibility)
- *GDACS* (alert-focused but non-interactive)

*DisasterConnect* is *citizen-powered, **mobile-first, and **AI-enhanced*, promoting real-time field engagement without the overhead of blockchain or complex infrastructures.
